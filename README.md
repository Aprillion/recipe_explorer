Proof of concept for Factorio recipe explorer tool.

### dump_json.lua
- copy&paste to Factorio console (press ` in a game)
- go to https://wiki.factorio.com/Application_directory#User_Data_directory and get scripts_output/recipe_explorer/*.json files
- TODO: make a mod - either console command or shortcut or automatically when loading/saving

### index.html
- for testing from file system, copy files produced by dump_json.lua in the same directory and open in Firefox (or start a web server)
- TODO: refactoring, find icons for mods, ... probably best to use github issues
